# Experiencing Krakatoa
## A Recess Week Volcano Voyage

**Published on Mar 12, 2018 by Prof Martin Henz and Dr John van Wyhe**

How might one fathom the vastness of the biggest explosion in human history, the Krakatoa eruption of 1883? Can textbooks ever adequately convey the immensity of such events, the destruction they wreak and the regional and even global fallout they produce?

The Krakatoa catastrophe only took place 135 years ago, and many of the resulting geological features are still in plain sight. Thus, our response to the educational challenge was to take the students on-site and immerse them in the landscape formed by that catastrophic event. We organised a Tembusu STEER voyage with the aim to visit the Krakatoa archipelago—our “Recess Week Volcano Voyage”—for 9 NUS students, 2 exchange students and 2 alumni. We boarded the 78-feet staysail schooner “Four Friends” in Jakarta on 24/2, set sail on 25/2 in the afternoon, and reached the Krakatoa archipelago in the Sunda Strait on 26/2 in the early morning hours. It was the ninth voyage by the NUS Seafarers, a Provost Office initiative that so far has taken 101 students and 8 alumni on immersive learning experiences in Indonesia and the Philippines, where they learned about the economy, society, biodiversity and geography of these maritime nations.

The tallest island of the Krakatoa archipelago is often partially hidden by clouds; it comprises the southern flank of the original pre-1883 Krakatoa volcano, an island today known as Rakata.

The following three days provided ample opportunities to study the archipelago, consisting of Rakata, two smaller Krakatoa remnants called Rakata Kechil and Sertung, and Anak Krakatau, a new volcanic island that emerged from the sea in 1927 in the vast seafloor hole created by the explosion. We explored the sea life that has re-established itself after the catastrophe, including several coral reefs and a large pod of dolphins, while snorkelling and navigating. We hiked through the tropical forest of Rakata and Rakata Kechil, which has grown back in the past 135 years on the fertile ash that the explosion deposited on the surrounding islands. We established the heights of the peaks of Anak Krakatau (302m) and Rakata (810m) using sextant, GPS, radar and high school trigonometry.
