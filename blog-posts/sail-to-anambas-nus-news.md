# Sail to Anambas

**Published on Jun 1, 2017 by NUS News**

A group of 12 NUS students from various schools and faculties went from strangers to friends when they took off on an unconventional journey, living and working together onboard a ship on an 11-day voyage to the remote Anambas Islands of Indonesia.

The group set off from neighbouring Batam island on 30 April on a schooner, an 18m ship with eight sails, headed northeast for the desolate islands. Accompanying and guiding them was a trio of faculty members — Associate Professor Martin Henz from NUS Computing, Assistant Professor Andrew Quitmeyer from NUS Communications and New Media, and Dr Matthias Hoffmann-Kuhnt from the Tropical Marine Science Institute and NUS Biological Sciences.

The Anambas Islands is a small archipelago in the South China Sea, with Peninsular Malaysia to its west and Borneo to its east. The team traversed over 740km for their voyage, making stops at the little-known islands and rocky outcrops — covering Tokong Malangbiru, the southern-most point of the Anambas islands; Pulau Bawah; Telok Bakau; and Sagu Dampar — to explore the relatively untouched nature. The students’ time at sea was spent learning the ropes on sailing and navigating. At the islands, they had the chance to try out a variety of activities, from rock-climbing and abseiling to snorkelling, kayaking and observing wildlife.
