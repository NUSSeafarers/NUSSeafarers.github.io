On the voyage, I had made it a goal of mine to try to spot as many animal species as possible. With this (almost childlike) objective, and bucket in hand (to catch-and-release smaller fish), I embarked on my journey. 

We had expected the animal populations to recover a little after the Covid-19 pandemic, but it seems that wasn't the case. As remarked by the Captain, you used to be able to see schools of dolphin everywhere, and we barely got a peep of them this entire voyage.

That extends to other animals too, in fact; sightings this time round were few and far between (to my dismay), but that made every discovery all the more exciting, to see a glimpse of something, anything at all, was immensely stimulating. 

I'll save the full details of our trip's stops for another article, but I'll make brief mention of the islands. 

On the first morning out at sea, we had anchored at Pulau Durai the night before, and what luck! We awoke to sea turtles mating by the sunrise, with no care to the fact they were being watched by several (voyeuristic) eyes.

So, that's one animal added to the tally, and what a start it was!

I was one of the lucky few to kayak out to get a closer look. As we approached, it seems our presence was unwelcome (or they'd finished), and they disappeared beneath the surface.

No matter, we later kayaked to explore Durai itself, where several turtle tracks were apparent on the beach. There also lived a small community that makes a living off selling, eating, and hatching turtle eggs. We got to see quite a handful of eggs, a fresh harvest from the early morning.

Next up, we anchored near {{TODO: Get a name for axel's resort}}, where we got to snorkel around the shallow reefs. Many fish and coral spotted here. Unfortunately, I'm not great with identifying species, so (almost) every fish was a fish, and every coral was a coral to me.

I then spotted a brilliantly blue starfish, and excitedly (inaudibly, too) gestured at my snorkeling peers to come look. It was later that I realised how abundant these were, turning out to be the only type of sea star I'd see this entire trip!

And who could miss the parrotfish? That was the one fish I could identify, thanks to its unique appearance, glistening in the water! Well, that and another puffer, which was on the brink of death by the time we'd found it floating by the shore. I had brought a bucket with me (finally, a use!), and we brought it back for everyone on deck to have a look before we tossed it back to the fishes. Dust to dust.

On other occasions, I'd put the buckets on deck to use beyond fetching seawater, earning me the title of "Bucketman" (I Think It's Going to be a Long, Long Time). Aiming my throw carefully, with a bucket attached to a rope, I scooped some jellyfish unfortunate enough to float past the schooner. We kept them around to inspect under the microscope we'd brought on deck, and then back to the sea they went as well.
