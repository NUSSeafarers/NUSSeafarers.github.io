On the voyage, I had made it a goal of mine to try to spot as many animal species as possible. With this almost childlike objective, and bucket in hand (to catch-and-release smaller fish), I embarked on my journey. 

We had expected the animal populations to recover a little after the Covid-19 pandemic, but it seems that wasn't the case. As remarked by the Captain, you used to be able to see schools of dolphin everywhere, and we barely got a peep of them this entire voyage.

That extends to other animals too, in fact; sightings this time round were quite minimal (to my dismay), but that made every discovery all the more exciting, to see a glimpse of something, anything at all, was immensely stimulating.
