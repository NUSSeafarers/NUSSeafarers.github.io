# Bo Bo Cha Cha’s Final Sail of 2024

More than just the name of a dessert, Bo Bo Cha Cha is one of NUS Seafarers’ most treasured assets, thanks to the generosity of Prof. Martin.

Before 2024 came to a close, Prof. Martin gathered a crew of sea-loving NUS members aboard for the boat’s final sail of the year. We started the day with a bit of TLC for Bo Bo Cha Cha, sanding… cleaning… and even some underwater barnacle-scraping courtesy of our bold Prof. Martin and Husna…

Lunch was at Changi Village, before we tacked close-hauled up the channel. A quick pit stop at the floating restaurant for icy lemongrass drinks kept us cool under the scorching sun, then it was a broad reach back to CSC.

The perfect finale was a breathtaking full-arc rainbow stretching from the sea to the trees along CSC’s shoreline, a perfect moment shared with perfect company.
