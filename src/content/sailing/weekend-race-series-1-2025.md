# Weekend Race Series 1 2025

CSC’s Twilight Series I was welcomed by cloudy skies and strong winds that ensured more-than-comfortable conditions for racing (thank you monsoon surge). The fleet saw a bunch of familiar faces and plenty of new ones, but of course all are welcome aboard the friendly conditions of the Twilight Series!

Thank you to Changi Sailing Club for the opportunity to collaborate and give our newbie sailors this chance to sail! This experience is very special to us as it is so rare for newer sailors to get the opportunity to sail and much less race, and especially to learn from and connect with experienced sailors!

Friends from Shardana, Jong Dee and Simba made up the IRC fleet. Skipper Atul of Simba gave 2 of our seafarers their very first taste of keelboat racing. Based on their reviews, it probably won’t be long before they find their way back out on the waters again. Shardana featured a few first-time keelboat sailors as well, so I guess you could say we’re all on the same boat (lol). The fastest boat in the fleet was our resident J35 Jong Dee, which was mostly crewed by sailors who’ve been sailing their whole lives, with the exception of our 2 newbies on board of course. Regardless, Jong Dee warmly welcomed them onboard and they enjoyed their sail very much (thank you Paul, Josei and Otso).

The PY class comprised a bigger fleet of Sapphire Star, Skybird, Birregurra, IMP, Nevis and Jock. On Skybird, we have the trusty duo Luke and Claire hosting and teaching our seafarer newbies the basics of racing (hope to sail with you next time Uncle Edwin!). Next, we have the talented but soft-spoken Basil at the helm of Birregurra, a glorious 10-ton vessel (that’s like 2 elephants)(don’t ask why I know).

Once again, a big thank you to Changi Sailing Club and friends from CSC for hosting and being so supportive of us, it is amazing to get to know everyone and share our passion for sailing together!
