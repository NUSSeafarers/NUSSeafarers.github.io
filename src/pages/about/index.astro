        The NUS Seafarers is a student-led initiative from the National University of Singapore, created to foster regional understanding through seafaring voyages. Since 2017, we’ve embarked on <strong>19 voyages</strong> with <strong>over 200 participants</strong>, visiting ports across Southeast Asia to learn from local communities, marine landscapes, and each other.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our voyages focus on cultural immersion, environmental reflection, and the philosophy that learning should be grounded in experience. As we sail through the archipelagos, we explore questions of sustainability, heritage, and our shared maritime future.
      </p>

      <p>
        We’re more than just a group that sails — we’re a community of learners, educators, sailors, and dreamers.
